# What is a Preprocessor?

### Step Before CSS
### Language on top of CSS
### Powerful Capabilities
  * Variables
  * Nesting
  * Mixins
  * Automatic Vendor Prefixing

### Better CODE --> DRY principal
### Powerful Frameworks and Libraries
________________________________________________________

## SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style-Sheets
* Original language
* Shorter syntax

## SCSS - Sassy CSS
* Newer Syntax
* Closer to CSS
* De-facto Standard

________________________________________________________
```scss
// SCSS
.container {
  float: left
  width: 100%;

  p {
    color: #333
  }

}

// SASS
.container
  float: left
  width: 100%;

  p
    color: #333
  
```

| SCSS | SASS |
| :-- | :-- |
| Curly braces and semi-colons | Indentation |
| Ignores whitespace | Strict rules for whitespace |
| @mixin my-mixin | =my-mixin |
| @include my-mixin | +my-mixin |
| @import foo | @import foo (same) |
| @extend foo | @extend foo (same) |

________________________________________________________

## Variables

First of all, the variables are defined like:
`$my-variable`.

* All lowercase with a dash in bewteen to separate words.
* This variable must be unique and can be used in many places.
* Variables can store any value regarding CSS scope.

________________________________________________________

## Partials

This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. ** A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore **. You might name it something like `_partial.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that ** the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file **. Sass partials are used with the `@use` rule.

Something interesting of this partials is the way that is preproccessed all of the content. It's like:

```scss
// _variables.scss

$text-size: 12px;

// output styles.css
$text-size: 12px;
p {
  font-size: $text-size;
}

```
It means that moves all of the content related to variables into `styles.css`

________________________________________________________

## Mixins

Allow us to create reusable pieces of code.

Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. ** You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible **. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes.

```scss
// With no arguments
@mixin my-mixin {
  background-color: orange;
  color: #fff;
}

```
### Arguments

```scss
@include my-mixin;
// With arguments
@mixin my-mixin($bg-color: orange, $color: black) {
  background-color: $bg-color;
  color: $color;
}
@include my-mixin(green, white);
@include my-mixin(green);
@include my-mixin($color: white);
@include my-mixin($color: white, $bg-color: tomato);

// Multiple values separated by comma
// It's called ** vararg **
@mixin box-shadow($shadows...) {
  box-shadow: $shadow;
  -moz-box-shadow: $shadow;
  -webkit-box-shadow: $shadow;
}

@include box-shadow(0 10px 1px 1px black, 1px 10px 1px 1px black);
```


### Content Directive

Allow us to pass content into our mixins. `@content`

```scss
@mixin apply-to-ie-6 {
  * html {
    @content;
  }
}
```
This means that is posible to pass any such a rule that we need to use for a specific element.

________________________________________________________

### Import Directive

```scss
@import url();
@import 'http://';
@import 'filename.css';
@import 'style-screen' screen;
```

SCSS preprocessor goes ahead and looks at the current directory we're in.

For instance if there is this kind of import in a SCSS file:

```scss
@import 'filename';

// SCSS styles

```
What the preprocessor does it's that first it take a look for the filename if it exists in the current directory. Then, it looks if in the current does have a partial or a simple SCSS file.

Also, it is **not** posible to have then:

```
// filename.scss and _filename.scss
```

The preprocessor will be confused.

Furthermore, it is posible to make a single line import like this one:

```scss
@import 'partials/variables', 'partials/mixins';
```

Notice, that this import is separated with a comma.

### Media Queries

We can nest selectors and media queries.

```scss
// For example this can be used for a single element:

@mixin small-screens() {
  @media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    @content;
  }
}

```

### SASS SHELL & Basic Arithmetic

`sass --interactive`

**It is important to understand that there are incompatibilities between value units**

```scss
// Sum pixels
.rule {
  witdh: 3px + 4px;
}

```

________________________________________________________

### Functions

```scss
// Sum pixels
.rule {
  color: rgb(10, 15, 50);
  color: hsl(60, 50%, 100%);
}

```
